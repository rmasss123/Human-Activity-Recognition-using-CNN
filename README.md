# Human Activity Recognition Using CNN

## Introduction
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a pivotal area within the field of computer vision and artificial intelligence, focused on the automated identification and classification of human actions or behaviors from sensor data or visual inputs. HAR finds applications in diverse domains such as healthcare, sports analytics, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. The goal of HAR systems is to infer the actions performed by individuals based on inputs such as images, videos, accelerometer data, or a combination of these modalities. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown remarkable success in HAR tasks due to their ability to automatically learn relevant features from raw input data, enabling accurate recognition of complex human activities




## Objective
Our objective is to develop a robust human activity recognition (HAR) system leveraging deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques. Initially, we aim to construct a base CNN model trained on a dataset comprising images representing 15 distinct human activities. This base model will serve as the foundation for our HAR system. Subsequently, we will employ transfer learning to adapt this base model to individual users by incorporating their specific image data. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model with user-specific data, we aim to enhance the accuracy and personalization of activity recognition predictions. Ultimately, our goal is to demonstrate the efficacy of deep CNNs and transfer learning in advancing HAR technology, enabling more accurate and tailored activity recognition systems across various domains.
